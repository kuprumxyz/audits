# Audits

I am `kuprum`, an experienced Web3 security researcher with main areas of expertise being L1 (EVM & Cosmos SDK chains), cross-chain communication (IBC / Bridges), complex infrastructure projects. Currently an independent security researcher. Previously worked at various companies, including being a Lead Web3 auditor in an audit company, also have experience in Web2 security, testing, and verification.

In my audits I deliver you the _highest quiality work_ above everything, and also tend to find severe, but hard/rare bugs that most others miss. Please feel free to browse my portfolio below, and also at [audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/kuprum](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/kuprum) or [cantina.xyz/u/kuprum](https://cantina.xyz/u/kuprum).

Before that I've done dozens of audits as a Lead Auditor in a Web3 audit company with the main focus on Cosmos SDK / IBC / Cross-chain / CosmWasm / Solidity.

More before that I've done a PhD in formal verification, and worked in various companies as a developer.
