# Judging experience

I've had a single judging experience so far, namely judging the [Mightly competition](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/616d8bb4-16ce-4ca9-9ce9-5b99d6e146ef) at Cantina. 
It was a challenge in many respects: many findings (1344), many AI-generated submissions, and difficulties of communications with the sponsor, to name a few. 
I am very proud that together with my fellow judge [Jiri123](https://cantina.xyz/u/Jiri123) we've been able to judge it with record-breaking speed, efficiency, 
and communication transparency. 
Our judging has attracted numerous praise from fellow SRs, see e.g. [this](https://x.com/Ril11111/status/1932805270822137964) 
and [this](https://x.com/0xhammadghazi/status/1927356751818436648) posts on X, and also the below screenshots from Discord:
